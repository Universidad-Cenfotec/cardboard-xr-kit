Cardboard XR Kit is an open-source Unity starter project maintained by **SpatialLab, the XR Lab at Universidad CENFOTEC**. It provides a lean baseline for building mobile VR experiences with the Google Cardboard XR Plugin, including a ready-to-run sample scene and curated XR settings to speed up prototyping.

## Overview
- **Unity LTS ready**: Configured for Unity `2021.3.44f1` with Android build support.
- **Cardboard-first**: Uses the official Google Cardboard XR Plugin for lightweight mobile VR.
- **Starter scene**: Includes a sample scene to validate rendering, input, and project setup out of the box.
- **Extensible**: Organize your own assets under `Assets/` while keeping XR configuration assets in `Assets/XR`.

## Getting started
### Prerequisites
- [Unity Hub](https://unity.com/download) with **Unity 2021.3.44f1** installed.
- **Android Build Support** (SDK, NDK, and OpenJDK components) added to the Unity Editor.
- An Android device with the Google Cardboard viewer for on-device testing.
